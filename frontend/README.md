# Cloud Resume Challenge Frontend

url: [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/)

This is the frontend for the Cloud Resume Challenge. It is built using Vite + React.js for all the heavy lifting. The components I've incorporated are from MaterialUI and the styling is achieved using TailwindCSS.

======================================================================================================================================

The website is fairly basic. I have built three web components: Header, Body, Footer. They aren't designed to be resuable as there is only one page for this application. Another component I built is a GenericAccordion component. It is an extension of MaterialUI's Accordion component and is built to be reusable in other areas of the website. I only used it in the Body element but it was used multiple times and could be incorporated in different ways if I were to extend this application further.

I have used multiple internet resources to help with the design of the page. The background image I obtained from here: [Eagle Nebula](https://earthsky.org/clusters-nebulae-galaxies/the-awesome-beauty-of-m16-the-eagle-nebula/). The other resources I didn't write down and don't remember but special thanks to anybody that blogs/writes about different and unique solutions to the many frontend needs. I appreciate you!
